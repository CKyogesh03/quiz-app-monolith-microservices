// to find the right answers of quiz set 2. id - denotes question id, right_answer denotes answers
//sql query
select id,right_answer from question
where id in (11,1,2,5,6);

// sending option like a,b,c,d (or) original answer data to back end
sending original answer with question id is preferred. bcoz if the options are shuffled randomly for every user then comparing with option is no use.
so compare question with answer.
fetch original answer by question id then compare original answer with submitted answer.
